					<p>Welcome to the VisualBitcoin website. 
                       <br/>This website is a monitoring system for the bitcoin network. 
                        Here you can find all necessary information for manipulating your bitcoins. 
                        <p>What is a bitcoin, you ask? </p>
                        <p>Bitcoin is a digital currency which is based on a cryptosystem. 
                        This currency is not managed by any bank, country or central authority, 
                        so it doesn’t depend on politics, cataclisms or other factors. </p>
                        <p>
                        Our site provides different statistical information, such as charts and diagrams,
                        to analyze the bitcoin network. 
                        You can also follow this activity from any part of the world just using your 
                        smart-phone or another device with a browser and internet.
                        <br/>
                        To see information on the latest generated blocks just open a Block Explorer page 
                        from the menu of the site (which is situated at the top). You will then see a 
                        detailed report on the 10 recent bitcoin mined blocks. If you'd rather see processed 
                        transactions then head over to the Transactions menu item. The statistics page 
                        will show you all you need to know about; here you can see 
                        a huge number of computer-generated charts and diagrams. Lastly, if you'd like to
                        find out more information on the project and license agreement or send us a message
                        head over to the About Us or Contact page respectively.</p>
